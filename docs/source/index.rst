Welcome to asciinema-director's documentation!
==============================================


`asciinema-director` is an easier way to use `asciinema`, the amazing terminal
recording tool.

I've used asciinema for a very long time and the biggest problem is making
flawless recordings.

This project seeks to automate the creation of those recordings, using a source
file that the user provides.
