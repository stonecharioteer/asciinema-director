`asciinema-director`
---------------------

`asciinema` is great. I use it everywhere. However, what isn't great is
our ability to type without making mistakes. Everytime I want to demo
something, I record an `asciinema` video, but I keep hitting backspace and
ruin the flow. Instead, I would love to be able to use something to make
flawless recordings.

`asciinema-director` is just that.

To install:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install asciinema-director
    $ asciinema-director --help                                                                                                                                                      git:(master*)
    Usage: asciinema-director [OPTIONS] SRC DEST

    Options:
    -D, --delay FLOAT
    --help             Show this message and exit.
